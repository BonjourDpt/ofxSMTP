ofxSMTP
=======

A Pure POCO SMTP Client (including SSL/TLS for Gmail, etc).


NOTE:  This is compatible with openFrameworks 0.8.0 or greater.  Past versions of openFrameworks (including 0.7.4) do not support SSL.  This addon is compatible with the openFrameworks development branch.


For now, also requires ofxSSLManager (https://github.com/bakercp/ofxSSLManager).
